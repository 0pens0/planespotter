Planespotter App
================
Welcome to the home of the Planespotter Cloud Native Demo App.

I developed this App to demonstrate various networking capabilities of VMware NSX in vSphere, Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry environments. If you are curious to see what a VMware NSX Demo with Planespotter looks like, you can watch this Presentation at Network Field Day 17:

Planespotter is composed of a MySQL DB that holds Aircraft registration data from the FAA. You can search through the data in the DB through an API App Server written in Python using Flask. The API App Server is also retrieving data from a Redis in memory cache that contains data from aircrafts that are currently airborne. There's a service written in Python that retrieves the Data about airborne aircrafts and pushes that data into Redis. Finally there is a Frontend written with Python Flask and using Bootstrap.

There's no specific mandatory way to deploy Planespotter. It can be deployed in various ways ranging from all in VMs, to Kubernetes, Cloud Foundry, etc.

Deployment Instructions:
========================
If you are planing to deploy the application using a VM only approach, follow the [VM based deployment instructions](https://github.com/yfauser/planespotter/tree/master/docs/vm_deployment/README.md).

If you want to have a deployment where everything including the MySQL DB is deployed in Kubernetes, you can follow the [full deployment in Kubernetes instructions](https://github.com/yfauser/planespotter/tree/master/docs/all_k8s_deployment/README.md).

Another option is to still deploy the MySQL DB using a VM based model, but keep everything else in Kubernetes. Follow the [VM and Kubernetes Deployment instructions](https://github.com/yfauser/planespotter/tree/master/docs/vm_k8s_deployment/README.md) for this.

If you want to mix VMs, Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry, follow the [VM, K8s, CF deployment instructions](https://github.com/yfauser/planespotter/tree/master/docs/vm_k8s_cf_deployment/README.md).

Last but not least, you can deploy everything in Cloud Foundry by following the [full deployment in Cloud Foundry instructions](https://github.com/yfauser/planespotter/tree/master/docs/all_cf_deployment/README.md)

Contributing & Feedback:
========================
I welcome any contributions through pull requests, direct communication, etc.
If you run into issues and need help, please open Github issues so that I can track this better and for other people to learn about open issues and potential workarounds.
